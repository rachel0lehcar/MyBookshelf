# MyBookshelf

(In progress) This web application is inspired by book tracking websites such as Goodreads and StoryGraph. It enables readers to keep track of the books they read, organize and keep notes.

## Description

Users can seach using the Google Books API to get information about the book such who the authors are, descriptions/summaries, and the genres it falls under. They can also choose to manually add the information. They then add their own rating and notes. Once submitted, the users can add their book to any number of collections they have created. Once it has been saved to the database, the users can view all of their saved books, or filter by genre or collection.

Users can also set a goal for how many books they want to read that year. They will be able to view the status of this goal on the home page.
